# Anzu for Windows 10

Anzu is a small tool for organizing files in Windows 10.

###### The program has a functional:
**Desktop**:
- *Backup desktop*. If you use the desktop as a "buffer" for files that are not really needed over time, but itâ€™s a pity to delete, then this is a function for you. It will add all the files from the desktop to the archive and put it in the folder you selected in the settings.
- *Sorting*. Sorts the desktop by file type (If you put a checkbox, a folder will be created for each extension)

**Download folder:**
- Sorts files by the standard path of the "Downloads" folder.
- Deletes files older than N days

**Custom folder:**
- Sort any selected folder. (Drag and drop works)
- Deletes files that are older than N days in any selected folder
